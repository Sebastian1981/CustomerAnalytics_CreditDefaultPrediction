The purpose of this AI project is to predict the risk that individuals will default on their loan repayments. The basis for this is freely accessible data from the Internet. This web application allows the user to visualize the underlying data with simple menu navigation, and then to train and evaluate machine learning models. In addition, an approach from game theory was implemented here to make model decisions transparent by visualizing the so-called Shapley values.
